/*
 *              Variables, and data are stored in memory.
 *              An array is just a bunch of contiginuous memory spaces
 *              When you create an array you have the array holding or "pointing" to a bunch of memory spaces.
 *              [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
 *              But when you set that array equal to other arrays,
 *              the other arrays are pointing to the SAME memory spaces.
 *              Since they are pointing to the same memory spaces, if one array is edited, all the arrays pointing to that same memory space(s)
 *              are also edited.
 *              
 *              But when you make a new array, you are initializing a new container to hold a group of completely new memory spaces
 * 				[8][9][10][11][12][13][14]
